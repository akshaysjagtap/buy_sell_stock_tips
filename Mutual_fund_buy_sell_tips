Mutual fund buy and sell tips

Invest in few mutual funds only. Many funds means many expense ratio and exit load.

Check for sectoral and thematic funds if in perfect buy range. 
For, example SBI technology oppurtunities fund, when IT sector was down at 6 months low or SMA below 200 days and nifty 50 was down 10 % on June 4, 2024. 

Amount to invest, one can invest entire amount if nifty down below 5 % or if sectoral fund below SMA 200 or both condition co-exist.  

One can invest in span of 2 to 3 days of nifty fallen below 5 %. 

Check for mutual fund with 60% in Large cap, 25% in Mid Cap, 15% Small cap like LIC MF Dividend yield fund or Nifty 100 ETF, Nifty Mid cap 150 ETF and Nifty small cap 250 etf. But fund return should beat ETF return 

Small AUM size fund but good returns as compared to peers can be best mutual fund to invest.
